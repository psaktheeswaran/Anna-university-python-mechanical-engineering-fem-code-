as a free version user on git hub how much mb can i upload on github or cani keep on cloning infinite code repos and adding new ones

As a free GitHub user, you can have unlimited public repositories and unlimited collaborators on those repositories, but the storage for each repository is limited to a maximum of 100GB. This means that you can keep cloning and adding as many repositories as you like, as long as the total size of all the repositories does not exceed 100GB. If you need more storage space, you can upgrade to GitHub's paid plans, which offer additional storage options.
